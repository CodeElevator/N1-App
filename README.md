# N1-App

This is a very early version of the app. Please expect bugs.

## How to download

Before downloading, we need to install python. Python is the programming language this app is written in and is essential in order to run the application.

### Download Python on Windows

Head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ or click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads).

Click the yellow button that says ´Download Python´.

This should bring up the file explorer asking where to download the file. Select the place where you want to download the python installer and click on save (this will download the python installer).

Once downloaded, run the installer.

Make sure to check the box `Add python.exe to PATH` at the bottom of the installer.

Click in `Install Now`. This will start the installation.

If every thing went well, the installer will say `Setup was successful`. Hooray! You can now close the window.
