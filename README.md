# N1-App

This is a very early version of the app. Please expect bugs.

## How to download

Before downloading the app, we need to install python. Python is the programming language this app is written in and is essential in order to run the application.

### Download Python on Windows

Before downloading Python, check if it's already installed.

To do that, open up a command prompt by typing `cmd` in the search bar and hitting `ENTER`.

Now type:

```
python --version
```

And hit enter.

If this command returns `Python (version)`, python is already installed.

If it returns errors (it will probably do) or something else, you need to download Python:

Head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ or click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads).

Click the yellow button that says `Download Python`.

This should bring up the file explorer asking where to download the file. Select the place where you want to download the python installer and click on `save` (this will download the python installer).

Once downloaded, run the installer.

Make sure to check the box `Add python.exe to PATH` at the bottom of the installer.

Click on `Install Now`. This will start the installation.

If everything went well, the installer will say `Setup was successful`. Hooray! Python is installed and you can now close the window.
