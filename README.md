# N1-App

This is a very early version of the app. Please expect bugs.

Before downloading the app, we need to install python. Python is the programming language this app is written in and is essential in order to run the application.

### Download Python on Windows

Before downloading Python, check if it's already installed.

To do that, open up a command prompt by typing `cmd` in the search bar and hitting `ENTER`.

Now type:

```
python --version
```

And hit enter.

If this command returns `Python (version)`, python is already installed.

If it returns errors (it will probably do) or something else, you need to download Python:

Head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ or click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads).

Click the yellow button that says `Download Python`.

This should bring up the file explorer asking where to download the file. Select the place where you want to download the python installer and click on `save` (this will download the python installer).

Once downloaded, run the installer.

Make sure to check the box `Add python.exe to PATH` at the bottom of the installer.

Click on `Install Now`. This will start the installation.

If everything went well, the installer will say `Setup was successful`. Hooray! Python is installed and you can now close the window.

### Download Python on macOS

Before installing Python, check if it's already installed.

Open `Spotlight` using `command + space` and type "terminal". Hit enter.

Now type:

```
python --version
```

And hit enter. If it displays a version of python you don't need to install python, otherwise, read furthermore to install python:

Head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ or click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).

Under `Stable Releases`, click on the first Python installer (it will look something like `* Download macOS 64-bit universal2 installer`)

Once downloaded, run the installer. Click continue, agree and install to everything (during the installation, the finder may open, don't worry, just close it).

If everything went well, the installer should say something like `Congratulations! Python 3.11.something for macOS was successfully installed.`. Cool, python is installed, close the window.

### Download Python on Linux

Most linux distros have Python installed already. You can still check by opening a terminal (`CTRL + ALT + T`) and typing:

```
python --version
```

If it shows a python version, python is already installed, otherwise, you can use this command to install it:

```
pip install python
```

## How to Download the App

### Windows

Scroll back to the top, and find the `Realeases` section on the right side. Click on `Version 1.0`.

Under `Assests`, click on `n1_app.exe` to download the app. Once you've downloaded it, double click it to run it.

Windows might bring up a screen saying `Windows Protected your PC`. Click on `more info` and click on `run anyways`.

This happens because the `.exe` file isn't signed and isn't used by many users. This lets Windows think it's a virus, but it's not. You can check the code for yourself! ;)

### macOS and Linux

No official release yet but you can run the code by downloading the `main.py` file.

**EXECUTABLE APP COMING FOR MACOS VERY SOON.**
